# hatgame
A small and basic RPG

Unique feature: Hats. Hats provide stats to the hero and can be used up as a one-time-use item for some kind of attack or effect in battle.

The rest of the game is pretty much just your standard rpg. Graphics implemented using Java's graphics. The game should be mostly randomly generated dungeon crawling. Goal is undecided, but maybe a boss at the end guarding something.

What's done?:
- Basic map generation (including random monster spawns)
- Basic monster and hero class
- Map movement
- Game states
- Menu System
- Framework for some later features
- Basic battle system

Currently working on:
- Battle graphics
- Different kinds of monsters
- Weapon and hat library

Needs to be implemented:
- Advanced battle system (hat game)
- Shops
- Random map design
- Story and goal
- Level system
- Abilities
