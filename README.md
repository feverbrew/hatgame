# hatgame
A small and basic RPG

Unique feature: Hats. Hats provide stats to the hero and can be used up as a one-time-use item for some kind of attack or effect in battle.
The rest of the game is pretty much just your standard rpg. Graphics implemented using Java's graphics. The game should be mostly randomly generated dungeon crawling. Goal is undecided, but maybe a boss at the end guarding something.

What's done?:
- Basic map generation (including random monster spawns)
- Basic monster and hero class
- Map movement
- Game states
- Framework for some later features

Currently working on:
- Menu system (this should be a class that can implemented for any game)
- Battle graphics

Needs to be implemented:
- Battle system (including special attacks and learning them)
- Shops
- Different kinds of monsters
- Random map design
- Story and goal
- Weapon and hat library
- Level system
